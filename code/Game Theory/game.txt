Game Theory:
• [First Write a Brute Force solution]
• Nim = all xor
• Misere Nim = Nim + corner case: if all piles are 1, reverse(nim)
• Bogus Nim = Nim
• Staircase Nim = Odd indexed pile Nim (Even indexed pile doesn't matter, as one player can give bogus moves to drop all even piles to ground)
• Sprague Grundy: [Every impartial game under the normal play convention is equivalent to a one-heap game of nim] 
Every tree = one nim pile = tree root value; tree leaf value = 0; tree node value = mex of all child nodes.
[Careful: one tree node can become multiple new tree roots(multiple elements in one node), then the value of that node = xor of all those root values]
• Hackenbush(Given a rooted tree; cut an edge in one move; subtree under that edge gets removed; last player to cut wins): 
Colon: G(u) = (G(v1)+1) ⊕ (G(v2)+1) ⊕... [v1, v2,.. are childs of u]
